Title:
Smart Bus Waiting Avoidance System( Smart Bus Cordination)

Problem statement :
In schools, colleges, and offices, buses often face delays at pickup points due to uncertainty about passenger availability.
Drivers usually wait at bus stops without knowing whether passengers are absent, late, or on the way. This results in unnecessary
waiting time and disrupts the bus schedule. The absence of a real-time communication system between passengers and drivers increases
confusion and inefficiency. Passengers who are already inside the bus are also affected by these delays. In some cases, manual communication 
is required to inform the driver, which is not reliable. Such delays can lead to stress and time loss for both passengers and transport staff. 
Transport administrators lack proper tools to manage attendance information effectively. A real-time passenger status notification system can provide
clear information to drivers before arrival. This system helps reduce delays and improves overall transportation efficiency.
